# Routing & Navigation Fundamentals tutorial using Angular CLI

This project is roughly based off of the Routing & Navigation tutorial in the Fundamentals section of the angular.io website (https://angular.io/guide/router).

If you've struggled through that tutorial wondering how to get to the finished product, there's a chance that this repo will help you.

Unfortunately, my path might be hard to follow as I made changes along the way to adapt to steps that weren't clearly laid out. But, the most major divergence of the path I took was practicing using the Angular CLI to generate the project, modules, components, services and guards for each step.  I also kept my modules organized slightly differently - initially inspired by the default behavior of Angular CLI.

I did make regular commits, mostly when I had a working versions and ready to start a new step in the tutorial.  To help lay cookie crumbs in my path, most commit messages begin with the section name that the respective changes are associated with.  I also tried to add Notes specifying which section of the tutorial is next.

I also made slight changes to abide a little closer to the Angular Style Guide when it made sense and seemed like I could get away with it and still keep up with the tutorial.

Lastly, I added the Angular CLI commands I used during each commit - though, there were some mistakes made that were rectified later.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Note: Tests were skipped in this exercise.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

Note: Tests were skipped in this exercise.
